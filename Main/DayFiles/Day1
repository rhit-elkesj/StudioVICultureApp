Love is the single most vital component in life, for it is the origin and foundation of all human interaction. It’s both giving and receiving, to experience another person and to have that person experience you. It’s the tool which we learn to experience the highest reality, God.
Ask yourself questions that reflect yourself as a person and others that are around you in terms of love.
