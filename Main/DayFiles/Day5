Arrogant love is not love. One must be able to forgive or give in to the other you love just in the name of love even if the one you love isn’t right.
Make amends with someone you fought with and admit the wrong that you've committed, don’t blame the person you fought against.
Today is Five Days of the Omer.
Hayom yom chamishi la’omer.
