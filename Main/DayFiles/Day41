Every person needs and has the capacity to bond with other people, with significant undertakings and with meaningful experiences. When you bond in one area of your life, it helps you bond in other areas. Remember, God gave you a divine soul that is nurturing and loving, so you must learn to recognize the voice within so that you can experience other peopleâ€™s souls and hearts, which can help you recognize the people who you can truly trust.
Commit sometime during each day or week to bonding with someone new or expressing your love for someone.
Today is Forty-One Days, which is Five Weeks and Six Days of the Omer.
