The Counting of the Omer is a 49 day Jewish practice for reflection and improvement. It introduces seven character traits that can be paired to create 49 permutations, each representing an aspect of one's character that can be improved. Each day starts with a blessing in the evening followed by a lesson and an activity to enforce it. The days are counted by absolute number and by its number within each week.
 Chesed (חֶסֶד) – <i> Loving-Kindness </i> <br> Gevurah (גְּבוּרָה) – <i> Justice and Discipline </i> <br> Tiferet (תִּפְאָרָה) – <i> Harmony and Compassion </i> <br> Netzach (נֶצַח) – <i> Endurance </i> <br> Hod (הוֹד) – <i> Humility </i> <br> Yesod (יְסוֹד) – <i> Bonding </i> <br> Malchut (מַלְכוּת) – <i> Sovereignty and Leadership </i>
The Seven human attributes are believed to be attributes of God, and the activities aim to develop those attributes. The 49 day practice leads to spiritual preparation and anticipation for the giving of the Mattan Torah, the gift of true freedom,upon completion. The day you receive the Mattan Torah is celebrated as the ability to transcend human limitations and touch the divine. The blessings mark each day as a time for reflection, revelation, and change.
The counting of the Omer originates in the biblical command of the Omer offering, which consists of one Omer of freshly harvested grain and is waved in the Holy Temple in Jerusalem. The offering occurred on the second day of Passover, after which forty-nine days were counted, and the Shavuot holiday was observed. Since the Holy Temple was destroyed, the offerings are no longer offered, but the counting until Shavuot is still performed. 
Blue is considered a primary choice because Shavuot is like the wheat harvest; it symbolizes growth until the actual harvest (Pentecost). But the Pentecost was initially the day the Torah came down to Mount Sinai. It’s said that the tablets he carried were “sapphire,” which is similar to blue. The progressive transition from blue to white represents the idea that you are being purified and becoming more like God.
